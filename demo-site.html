        Outback Nursery is one of the largest garden centres on Vancouver
        Island. Our nursery is situated on a 6 acre property and offers 5
        overflowing greenhouses (30x170ft); almost 23,000 square feet. Outback
        Nursery began in 1998-1999 when our parents retired to the island from
        Aldergrove. They asked if we'd be interested in joining them and then
        purchased this heavily treed property. We began clearing some trees and
        settled into country life trying our hand at raising some turkeys and
        pigs as well as growing some hedging and conifers. We joined the
        Farmer's Market, then as our inventory expanded we began running a spec
        truck down island stopping here and there to show our quality product to
        potential customers. Little by little the property was cleared and one
        by one the greenhouses and irrigation zones increased to what you see
        today. In the beginning we were limited to wholesale and landscape
        clientele, then somewhere along the way interest in our nursery grew and
        we opened to the public.
